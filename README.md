#animate-js

*a micro-animation framework for JavaScript*

##Concept

**animate-js** is super-lightweight animation framework that can be used to animate *'anything'*.

The library knows nothing about what kinds of things you are trying to animate, it doesn't change
the properties of the things you are animating itself, but provides callbacks for you to do this yourself. Basic timeline controls are provided to manipulate animations from your own scripts.

This was created to syncronize the animation of CSS properties and SVG values. The code needed to 
work cross-browser on latest builds, and work on Internet Expolorer as far back as IE9.

**Library size:** ~1 kb

##Basic Usage

First we include the *animate.min.js* script in your page:

    <script src="animate.min.js" type="text/javascript" ></script>

Then define your timeline with an object-reference and an ojbect containing frames values. In the example below, we are controlling the opacity of a DOM element. We are getting the object using
jquery with: `$('#someid')`.

At second `0`, we want the opacity value to be `1`, at second `1` we want the  opacity value to be
`0`; and so on.

    var timeline = animate($('#someid'), {
      0: 1,
      1: 0,
      2: 1 
    });

Provide an update callback. This is where you apply the animation to the object(s) you want to 
animate. The scope of *`this`* within each callback is the timeline object.

    // Provide a callback for each update of the timeline
    timeline.onUpdate(changeOpacity);

Your update callback make look somethinglike this:

    function changeOpacity (obj, val) {
      obj.setAttribute('opacity', val);
    }

Begin playing the animation.

    timeline.play();

That's it!

Simple.

##Timeline Control

###`timeline.play()`

Begins playing a timeline.

###`timeline.pause()`

Pauses a timeline at it's current position.

###`timeline.restart()`

 - Pauses a timeline at it's current position.
 - Resets the playhead to the start of the animation.
 - Begins playing the timeline again.

###`timeline.onUpdate(callback)`

Functions passed to onUpdate() will be fired every time the internal animation timer is fired.

    function changeOpacity (obj, val) {
      obj.setAttribute('opacity', val);
    }

    timeline.onUpdate(changeOpacity);

###`timeline.onEnd(callback)`

Functions passed to onEnd() will be fired once when the animation has finished. Before the callback
is fired, the timeline will be stopped. You will have to call play if you want it to play again.
    
    timeline.onEnd(callback);

###Looping Timelines

Use the `onEnd(callback)` to loop a timeline, like this:
    
    function restartCallBack () {
      this.restart();
    };

    timeline.onEnd(restartCallback);

##Extending Easing Types

Use the `extend()` method to add new types of easing. **animate-js** ships with *linear* only out of the box. You can find more easing extensions in `./tests/`.

    // Add a new easing method
    animate().extend('easing', {
      outCubic: function (t, b, c, d) {
        return c*((t=t/d-1)*t*t + 1) + b;
      }
    });
